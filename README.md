### How to add your hackable plaything

1. Open `index.html`
2. Find the `plaything template`.
3. Copy-paste it where you want your plaything to appear.
3. Uncomment the `<article> ... </article>` block.
4. Write a *short description* for your plaything. Use it in:

  - the `<p class="description">`
  - the `<img alt="">` alt text
  - the `<!-- -->` comment above the `<article>`
5. List the *learning points* of your plaything in the `<div class="learning-goals">`.
6. Add *links* to:

  - view your plaything
  - remix your plaything (source-code)
7. Take a screenshot / animated gif of your plaything and link it to `<img src="">`. Keeping a 3x2 image ration (eg: 600x400 px) would be nice :)
